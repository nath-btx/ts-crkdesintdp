We have a class Dealer, with a Subclass Card and Player
The Dealer will start by drawing two cards for himself and the Player
The player can either Stay(), or Draw() a new card using the public method from the Dealer
Everytime the Player or Dealer uses Draw(), the cards sum is counted using Count() to check if he goes above 21
If Player or Dealer does go above 21, the method Lose() is called and player loses the game.
If player uses Stay() and doesn't bust, its back to the Dealer
The Dealver will Draw() until he goes above 17, once he does we count the Cards of the Player and Dealer, we decide a winner
