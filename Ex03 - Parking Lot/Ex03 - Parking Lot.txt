We have a class Parking, which contains two sub-classes : Floor
The subclass Floor contains a subclass Spot
Each spot has a name which is a String, and a Boolean isFree that says if it is free or available

The subclass Floor has :
- Integer to know which floor it is
- CountFreeSpots method that counts how many Spot subclasses have the isFree boolean on True
- An integer availableSpots which is the result of CountFreeSpots

The Parking class has :
 - the Method totalFreeSpots() that summs up the availableSpots from each subclass

 - an AvailableSpots which is the result of totalFreeSpots()
